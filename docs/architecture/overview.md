# Architecture Overview

## Purpose

The PR Review Agent is a stateless CLI tool that:

1. Is triggered by Jenkins when a PR is opened or updated
2. Fetches the diff and relevant file context from Bitbucket (or later: GitHub/GitLab)
3. Assembles a structured prompt and sends it to Claude
4. Posts the review as a comment on the PR
5. On re-triggers: skips if already reviewed (commit hash dedup), responds to developer
   questions (comment replies), or produces a delta review (new commits)

No code is checked out. No data is stored. One run = one review (or one reply).

## Review Flow (Finite State Machine)

The review orchestration in `src/review/index.ts` is implemented as an explicit finite state machine.
A `State` enum defines every node, a `ReviewContext` object carries accumulated data, and a
`transition(state, ctx)` function returns the next state. The runner loops until `DONE`.

The `FETCH_DIFF` state also produces a **filtered diff** (lock files stripped) which is
used for all Claude API calls. The raw diff is kept for line counting and threshold checks.

```
FETCH_PR_INFO → CHECK_BRANCHES
                  ├─ [source/target match skip patterns] → SKIP → DONE
                  └─ FETCH_DIFF (+ filterDiff) → CHECK_THRESHOLDS
                                  ├─ [fail] → SKIP → DONE
                                  └─ CHECK_PREVIOUS_REVIEWS
                                       ├─ [same commit] → CHECK_REPLIES
                                       │   ├─ [replies] → RESPOND_TO_REPLIES → DONE
                                       │   └─ [none] → SKIP → DONE
                                       ├─ [delta diff empty after filter] → CHECK_REPLIES
                                       │   ├─ [replies] → RESPOND_TO_REPLIES → DONE
                                       │   └─ [none] → SKIP → DONE
                                       └─ LOAD_PROMPT → FETCH_CONTEXT → CALL_CLAUDE
                                            → CHECK_NO_CHANGE
                                               ├─ [NO_CHANGE] → SKIP → DONE
                                               └─ JUDGE_REVIEW
                                                    ├─ [JUDGING_MODEL set] → validate → POST_REVIEW → DONE
                                                    └─ [no judge] → POST_REVIEW → DONE
```

**15 states**, **7 possible outcomes**: skip (branch exclusion), skip (threshold),
skip (same commit, no replies), skip (delta diff empty, no replies), skip (reply limit reached),
reply to developer, skip (NO_CHANGE), or post review. The optional `JUDGE_REVIEW` state sends the review output and diff to a
separate judge model (`JUDGING_MODEL`) that validates each finding against the actual code
before posting. When no judge is configured, this state is a no-op passthrough.

### POST_REVIEW Safety Guards

Before posting, `POST_REVIEW` applies two guards:

1. **Empty/NO_CHANGE guard** — if the review text is empty or equals `"NO_CHANGE"` after
   cleanup, the post is skipped. Prevents accidentally posting blank or literal `NO_CHANGE`
   strings when `CHECK_NO_CHANGE` is bypassed or the model misbehaves.

2. **Pre-post dedup** — on non-dry-run runs with `--force` off, the agent re-fetches the
   latest review comments immediately before posting and checks whether another concurrent
   run already reviewed the same commit. If a matching review is found, the post is skipped.
   Prevents duplicate reviews from parallel Jenkins triggers on the same PR update.

### Delta Diff Pre-Check

When a previous review exists with a different commit hash, the agent fetches the
commit-to-commit diff (last reviewed commit → current head) before proceeding. After
applying `DIFF_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS`, if zero lines remain, no review is produced — but the
agent still falls through to `CHECK_REPLIES` to answer any unanswered developer questions
before exiting. If there are no pending replies either, the run exits as `NO_CHANGE` with
no API call. This catches cases where new commits only touch excluded files (tests, lock
files, translations).

## Out of Scope (Explicitly)

- No local git checkout at any point — everything via API
- No storing PR content or diffs beyond the current request
- No modifying or approving PRs — comment only
- No persistent database — stateless per run
